    <p>The Hirakud Dam spans the Mahanadi River and is the longest dam in India. It became one of the first initiatives handled in a post-independence era. On 12 April-1948, Jawahar Lal Nehru, the nation’s first Prime Minister, laid the foundation stone for the Dam. Mazumdar Group was constituted to assess the scientific quality and viability of the project, which cost over 1 billion dollars in the old period, for sufficient monitoring. Originally, the Committee estimated that the Dam would cost roughly 94 crores and that it would be completed by June 1955.</p>
